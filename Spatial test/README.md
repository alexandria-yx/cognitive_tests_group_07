The spatial reasoning test is designed to examine user's 3d conception. All the images of cubes are pre-generated. The test consists of 3 multiple choice questions, each in increasing difficulty and corresponding score. More cubes in each image, more colors, and more complex configuration. In each question user will be given a 3d image of cubes, and asked to select from 4 options the 2d face that cannot be made by 3d image of cube. Before taking the test, users will be asked for information such as gender, nationality. The total scores achieved by each user will be analyzed later. In order to run the test, the users are required to download the questions in the form of images on their laptop.

Compared to the first version, the following changes are made: 1. Addition of ‘clear’ function to clear off past inputs by user. 2. Adding the use of HTML display to show emphasized and highlighted instructions.
