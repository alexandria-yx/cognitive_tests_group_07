The memory test consists of 3 rounds; in each round a grid of different coloured shapes is displayed on the screen for 20 seconds. Then it disappears and the user's memory is tested with questions on the positions, colours, types of shapes. The score for each round is recorded and a performance reflection question is asked at the end.
Users should run the 'Outside python test.ipynb' file from a folder containing all the files and images in this folder. Run the kernel to begin the test. The privacy disclaimer should be displayed first, and then users should follow instructions to continue.
Since v1 of this memory test, the following changes have been made:
1. Messages displayed to users use HTML format to increase clarity
2. Fewer questions to ensure that the test can be completed in roughly 3 minutes
3. Added reference photo/key for the shapes and their spellings to aid users in answering the questions correctly
4. Display message to tell users if they answered correctly or incorrectly
